# temp-call-for-service-scraper
This is a temporary scraper that gets the calls for service to the Milwaukee Police Department by scraping the site [MKE Police Call Logs](https://mke-police.herokuapp.com/about). The scraper focuses on the summer months of 06/01 - 07/31 over the years of 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. It's to monitor any potential changes in trends during the Republican National Convention of 2024.
